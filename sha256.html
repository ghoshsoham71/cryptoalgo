            <h1>SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)</h1>
            
            <section>
                <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
                <p>SHA-256 is a part of the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions, designed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and published in 2001.</p>

                <h2><b>Working</b></h2>
                <p>SHA-256 operates on 512-bit blocks of data. The input is first padded and then processed in 512-bit chunks. The algorithm uses a series of logical functions, constants, and word operations to iteratively generate a 256-bit hash.</p>

                <h2><b>Application</b></h2>
                <p>SHA-256 is used in various security applications and protocols, including TLS, SSL, PGP, SSH, and IPsec. It's also used in blockchain technology, including Bitcoin, for verifying transactions.</p>

                <b>Time Complexity: </b>O(N) For a message of N bits, the number of 512-bit blocks is N/512. The overall complexity is the product of the number of blocks and the complexity per block.</i><br>
                <br>
                <b>Space Complexity: </b>O(1) Includes message schedule storage, working variables, and intermediate hash values.</i>

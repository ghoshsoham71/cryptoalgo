            <section>
                <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
                <p>RC4 is a stream cipher known for its simplicity and speed, utilizing a variable-length key to initialize a state array. It generates a pseudorandom keystream, which is XORed with plaintext for encryption, and with ciphertext for decryption.</p>

                <h2><b>Working</b></h2>
                <p>RC4 algorithm uses a key-scheduled permutation array (S-box) and generates a keystream by performing byte-wise XOR operations between the S-box and plaintext, producing a secure ciphertext stream. It operates efficiently with variable key lengths.</p>

                <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
                <p>AES is a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information. It was established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.</p>

                <h2><b>Working</b></h2>
                <p>AES operates on a 4×4 column-major order matrix of bytes, termed the state. The key size used for an AES cipher specifies the number of repetitions of transformation rounds: 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.</p>

                <h2><b>Application</b></h2>
                <p>AES is widely used for secure communication in various applications, including wireless security, file encryption, and secure communications over the internet (HTTPS).</p>

                <b>Time Complexity: </b>O(M⋅N<sub>b</sub>⋅N<sub>r</sub>) <i> &#8776; O(1) The total time complexity for encrypting/decrypting a message of M blocks is the product of the time complexity per block and the number of blocks, which are constants- standard number of rounds are 10 (128 bits), 12 (192 bits) or 14 (256 bits) depending on the key size.</i><br>
                <br>
                <b>Space Complexity: </b>O(N<sub>k</sub>⋅(N<sub>r</sub>+1)+N<sub>b</sub><sup>2</sup>) <i> &#8776; O(1) Includes both the expanded key storage and the state storage.</i>
